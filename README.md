Landing Page Project

This project is a modern and responsive Landing Page built with React and Tailwind CSS.
The main goal was to practice responsive design, component structuring, and modern UI development using Tailwind’s latest syntax and utilities.

🚀 Technologies Used

React.js – for component-based UI development

Tailwind CSS – for styling and responsiveness

Vite – for fast development and build optimization

💡 Features

Fully responsive layout

Clean and modern design

Simple navigation bar

Styled buttons with hover effects

🧠 What I Learned

Throughout this project, I learned how to:

Apply Tailwind’s new syntax and configuration, which was quite different from older versions I had studied before.

Structure and organize components in React for better readability.

Make layouts responsive using Tailwind’s media query utilities.

⚙️ Challenges

At first, I struggled with Tailwind’s latest version, because I was still using the old syntax and configuration from previous tutorials.
It took me some time to understand how the new setup works, but after troubleshooting and checking the documentation, I finally managed to make it work — and learned a lot in the process.
